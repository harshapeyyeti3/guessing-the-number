# guessing-the-number
A clean and structured implementation of a two-player 3-digit guessing game in C.

Each player sets a hidden 3-digit secret number, and players alternate guessing each other's secret.
For each guess, the program reports:

Correct-position matches (right digit, right place)

Wrong-position matches (right digit, wrong place)

The match-checking logic avoids double counting and handles repeated digits correctly.
The game ends when both players successfully guess their opponent’s number.

This project demonstrates:

User input validation

String handling for digit processing

Array-based match checking

Clear function separation and game loop logic

Ideal for beginners practicing logic building and function-based programming
